## üç∑ Project description

---
**WineHood is an e-commerce application for wine discovery and purchase, allowing users to browse curated wines, manage shopping carts, place orders, and leave reviews.
The system supports role-based access, where administrators manage wine inventories, regions, and order statuses, while users can explore wines, submit reviews, and track their orders.
With support for JWT-based authentication and robust validation, WineHood ensures secure operations.
Built with Spring Boot, it features pageable RESTful APIs, Liquibase for database versioning, and structured domain logic with MapStruct and DTOs.
The platform includes dynamic search capabilities by wine attributes and region, detailed order history, and modular design for future extensions.**

## üåø Project structure

---
**The application follows a classic 3-tier architecture:**

- **Controller Layer:** Handles incoming HTTP requests, routes them to appropriate services, and formats outgoing responses.
- **Service Layer:** Implements the core business logic and handles transaction management and validation.
- **Repository Layer:** Interacts with the database using Spring Data JPA, enabling CRUD operations on domain entities.

**The core domain entities include:**

- **User:** Represents an individual using the platform, supporting both customer and administrator roles.
- **Role:** Defines access control levels (e.g., USER, ADMIN) assigned to users.
- **Wine:** Represents an item in the wine catalog with attributes like name, price, grape variety, and region.
- **Region:** Defines a wine-producing geographic area and links wines to regions.
- **Review:** Stores user-submitted feedback and ratings for wines.
- **ShoppingCart:** Represents the collection of wines a user intends to purchase.
- **CartItem:** An individual wine and quantity pair within a shopping cart.
- **Order:** Represents a completed purchase made by a user, including status and shipping information.
- **OrderItem:** Describes individual items included in a user‚Äôs order.
